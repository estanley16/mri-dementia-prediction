Analysis and predictions using cross-sectional MRI data from the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies

> The Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) is a project aimed at making MRI data sets of the brain freely available to the scientific community. By compiling and freely distributing MRI data sets, we hope to facilitate future discoveries in basic and clinical neuroscience. OASIS is made available by the Washington University Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Research Center, Dr. Randy Buckner at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI)( at Harvard University, the Neuroinformatics Research Group (NRG) at Washington University School of Medicine, and the Biomedical Informatics Research Network (BIRN).
